      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>The goal of the game is to be the first player to win three inner games in a row. Thereby winning the outer board.</p>
      <p>The first player can play anywhere on any of the nine inner boards.</p>
      <p>Subsequent moves must be played on the board that corresponds to the position of your opponent's most recent move.</p>
      <p>For instance, if your opponent makes a move in the top-left corner of the bottom-right board, your next move will have to be somewhere in the top-left board.</p>
      <p>If your opponent forces you to make a move on a board that is already complete, you can move on any of the boards.</p>
      <p>Play proceeds in this fashion until one player has won three games in a row. They win.</p>
